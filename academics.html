		<h5>WHich brought me here :PRERNA CLASSES</h5>
		<p class="description">
			If you are reading about me now and know me... It's because of this place. Running from School to Coaching never seemed hectic as I absolutely loved this place.
			I was a coaching ranker but due to bad health the JEE Advanced 2019 didn't go well which led me to opt CSE at NIT Suratkal.

		The place where I always wanted to be. Though this was not easy for me as i risked my fixed NITK seat i.e dropped out of college to give JEE again as you know circumstances like fever shouldn't decide one's future.
		So now I am here with a not so good rank of 2962 in JEE 2020
